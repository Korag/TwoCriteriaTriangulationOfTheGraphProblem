# TwoCriteriaTriangulationOfTheGraphProblem

On the basis of the created program, a scientific article was written and published:

Czepielik Ł., Boroń K., Pezda D.(2020) The problem of graph tripartition in a two-criteria evolutionary approach. In: Rysiński J., Drobina R. (eds) Processing, transmission and security of information - 2020 vol. 2. Wydawnictwo Naukowe Akademii Techniczno-Humanistycznej (http://www.engineerxxi.ath.eu/book/przetwarzanie-transmisja-i-bezpieczenstwo-informacji2020/)

The created window application allows to solve the two-criteria problem of graph triangulation using a genetic algorithm. The criteria considered are: the number of edges between vertices in different groups and the sum of weights of such edges.

Steps of the algorithm:

1. Generating a random graph based on the set probability parameters
2. Visualization of the incident matrix and weight matrix of the generated graph
3. Launching a genetic algorithm whose parameters can be tuned from the user interface
4. Visualization in each iteration of Pareto Front and fluctuation charts of the fitness function value of the best individual
5. Visualization in each iteration of the best individual in the form of a graph with a marked triangulation
6. The algorithm ends when the limit iteration is reached (number of iterations is entered by the user)
